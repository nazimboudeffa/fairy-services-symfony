# fairy-services-symfony

I have made a clone of [COCORICO](https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/cocorico-symfony3), it was coded in Symfony 3 but abondonned even if they said that Open Source is in their ADN

Cocos Lab thanks but try to keep it up

I am developping it following [the Symfony 5 course on OpenClassRoom](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/5489656-construisez-un-site-web-a-l-aide-du-framework-symfony-5)
